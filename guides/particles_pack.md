# ðŸ’¨ Particles Pack
Show particles to the game using the Better Armor Stands module.

To select a particle, write one of the available codes into a book and quill, and right-click an armor stand.
The armor stand will become invisible and display the selected particle.
Holding a book and quill will make any invisible armor stand in an 8-block radius glow to show their locations.

To remove the particle from an armor stand, right-click the armor stand with a book and quill again, with "default", and it will reappear and stop emitting particles.
